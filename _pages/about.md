I am currently a second-year master's student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), currently working
on low-resource event-type detection under the supervision of [Teruko
Mitamura](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~teruko/) and [Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/)

My interest is mainly on understanding why things happen, and as of now it is on problems related to
language technology.

I have previously worked on entity recognition using hypergraph-based models, under the supervision
of [Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei).

Being trained as a mathematician, I am particularly proud of my work on proving the linear-time
complexity of a model my colleague proposed for entity recognition (see [Efficient Dependency-guided
 Named Entity Recognition](/publication/2017-01-01-dependency-guided-ner)).

 I also enjoy teaching, and is currently preparing for PhD to better qualify myself for teaching
 positions, although I am open for industry positions as well.
