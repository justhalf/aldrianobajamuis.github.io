**I am currently looking for jobs**

I am currently a senior data scientist at Traveloka Technology Pte Ltd (Traveloka), working on
chatbot project, mainly to help reduce the burden of customer service agents by automating some
routine cases.

Prior to that, I finished my master's study at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working
on low-resource event-type detection under the supervision of [Teruko
Mitamura](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~teruko/) and [Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/)

My interest is mainly on understanding why things happen, and as of now it is on problems related to
language technology.

I have previously worked on entity recognition using hypergraph-based models, under the supervision
of [Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei).

Being trained as a mathematician, I am particularly proud of my work on proving the linear-time
complexity of a model my colleague proposed for entity recognition (see [Efficient Dependency-guided
 Named Entity Recognition](/publication/2017-01-01-dependency-guided-ner)).

I also enjoy teaching, and is currently preparing for PhD to better qualify myself for teaching
positions, although I am interested in research industry positions as well (see my [CV](/cv) for my
work experience)
